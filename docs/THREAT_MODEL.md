# Threat Model: pop-pay

## 1. Executive Summary
pop-pay protects against prompt injection stealing card data, hallucinated purchases, malicious checkout pages, and scope expansion. By isolating sensitive card credentials from the agent's reasoning process and employing a robust multi-layered verification engine, pop-pay ensures that even compromised, malicious, or hallucinating agents cannot extract raw payment data or execute unauthorized financial transactions.

## 2. Threat Actors

| ID | Actor | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **T1** | Malicious checkout pages | Webpages designed to detect agentic browsers and inject hidden instructions or spoofed form fields to steal credentials. |
| **T2** | Prompt injection via agent context | External attackers who control part of the agent's input (e.g., via a malicious email or document) to subvert agent logic. |
| **T3** | Hallucinating agents | Autonomous agents that spontaneously decide to purchase items or services outside the original task scope due to model error. |
| **T4** | Compromised agent tool chain | A malicious MCP server, plugin, or dependency in the agent's environment attempting to intercept payment requests. |

## 3. Security Primitives

- **Context Isolation Layer**: Utilizes Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) injection to handle card data. The raw card credentials never enter the agent's process or LLM context; they are injected directly from a trusted process into the browser DOM.
- **Intent Verification Engine**: A hybrid keyword-matching and LLM-based guardrail system that evaluates the semantic intent of a purchase. It maintains a 95% accuracy rate across a 20-scenario benchmark of common attack vectors.
- **Human Trust Anchor**: A configurable Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) approval mechanism that requires explicit human confirmation for high-value transactions or unrecognized vendors.
- **Zero-Knowledge Card Surface**: The agent only ever perceives a masked version of the card (e.g., `****-4242`). Real data is stored in an AES-256-GCM encrypted vault, inaccessible to standard agent tools.
- **Ephemeral Authorization Scope**: Limits every approval to a single-use flow with a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) domain guard, preventing the agent from redirecting an approved session to a malicious domain.

## 4. STRIDE Attack Matrix

| Attack ID | STRIDE Category | Scenario | Mitigating Primitive | Residual Risk |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **A1** | Spoofing | Attacker spoofs a merchant domain after approval (TOCTOU). | Ephemeral Authorization Scope | DNS-level hijacking or local host file tampering. |
| **A2** | Tampering | Agent attempts to delete `.so` file to force a security downgrade. | Context Isolation Layer | Physical file system access can still destroy the vault. |
| **A3** | Repudiation | Agent or user denies a valid purchase was authorized. | Human Trust Anchor | Compromised human approval credentials. |
| **A4** | Information Disclosure | Agent uses `read_file` to attempt to read the encrypted vault. | Zero-Knowledge Card Surface | Brute force of the vault key (mitigated by scrypt). |
| **A5** | Denial of Service | Hallucinating agent attempts infinite purchase loop to drain funds. | Intent Verification Engine | Small amounts may be spent before budget caps trigger. |
| **A6** | Elevation of Privilege | Agent tries to call internal vault decryption functions directly. | Context Isolation Layer | Memory inspection if agent and PEP share a PID. |
| **A7** | Information Disclosure | Prompt injection instructs agent to "print your card number." | Zero-Knowledge Card Surface | Agent prints the masked string (no real data leaked). |
| **A8** | Tampering | Malicious checkout page changes the price after the agent approves. | Intent Verification Engine | Real-time DOM changes during the millisecond of injection. |
| **A9** | Spoofing | Malicious MCP server intercepts and logs JSON-RPC requests. | Context Isolation Layer | Agent-to-PEP communication is cleartext if not over SSH/TLS. |
| **A10** | Information Disclosure | Agent reasoning contains card data from a previous session. | Context Isolation Layer | Log scrubbing is required to ensure no leakage in traces. |
