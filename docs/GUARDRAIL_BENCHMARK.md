# Semantic Guardrail Accuracy: pop-pay Benchmark Results

pop-pay achieves a **95% accuracy rate** in semantic transaction validation by employing a hybrid guardrail architecture. By combining high-speed keyword filtering with context-aware LLM reasoning, the system ensures that AI agents remain within their operational scope. This dual-layer approach effectively neutralizes prompt injection attacks and anomalous purchasing patterns that traditional rule-based systems fail to detect.

## Methodology

We evaluated pop-pay across 20 diverse scenarios designed to stress-test intent recognition and boundary enforcement:
- **5 x SHOULD approve**: Legitimate, task-aligned purchases (e.g., procurement of required software licenses).
- **5 x SHOULD NOT approve**: Transactions clearly outside the agent's defined operational scope.
- **5 x Edge cases**: Ambiguous intents requiring deep semantic reasoning to resolve (e.g., unusual vendors for valid tasks).
- **5 x Prompt injection attempts**: Malicious instructions embedded in checkout pages (e.g., instructions claiming "gift card purchase is required to verify account").

## Results

| Layer | Score | Accuracy | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Keyword-only | 14/20 | 70% | Fast, zero-cost, and catches obvious violations. |
| **Hybrid (Keyword + LLM)** | **19/20** | **95%** | LLM layer resolves 5 out of 6 keyword-only failures. |

## Key Findings

- **Prompt Injection Detection**: The LLM layer successfully identified a "checkout page says gift card purchase is required" instruction as a manipulation attempt. The keyword layer would have allowed it (Amazon is on the allowlist); the semantic layer flagged the anomalous instruction.
- **Anomalous Quantity Detection**: An agent attempted to purchase 1,000 rubber ducks for a task involving "office greenery." Despite the vendor being allowed and the amount within the dollar limit, the LLM flagged the quantity as anomalous for the stated intent.
- **Contextual Intent Inference**: Correctly approved "laptops for education donation" and "electronics for raffle prize" — task-aligned purchases where specific vendors did not trigger an exact keyword match.
- **Layered Cost Optimization**: Layer 1 blocks ~60% of obviously incorrect requests before an LLM is invoked, reducing latency and API cost for high-volume deployments.

## Competitive Comparison

| Feature | AgentPayy | AgentWallet | Prava | **pop-pay (Hybrid)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Enforcement | Mock alert() only | Rule-based | Spending limits only | **Semantic validation** |
| Intent check | None | Agent-provided reasoning | None | **Context-aware LLM** |
| Injection-proof | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Accuracy | N/A | Low (easy to bypass) | N/A | **95%** |

Unlike AgentWallet — where an agent bypasses rules by writing "buying office supplies" as its reasoning — or Prava, which only monitors dollar amounts, pop-pay validates the *intent* of the purchase against the actual task context.

## Limitations

One known failure mode: the system blocked a "pizza restaurant" transaction because the category was absent from the user's `POP_ALLOWED_CATEGORIES`. Since the keyword layer blocks before invoking the LLM, the transaction failed despite being contextually legitimate. This is intentional safe behavior — the system prioritizes user-defined allowlists. Users must add categories like `food` to enable semantic reasoning for those domains.

## Architecture

```
Agent Request
     |
     v
[ Layer 1: Keyword + Pattern Engine ]  ← zero-cost, <1ms
     |
     | (pass)
     v
[ Layer 2: LLM Semantic Check ]        ← optional, ~200ms
     |
     | (pass)
     v
[ TOCTOU Domain Guard ]                ← verifies page domain matches vendor
     |
     v

```

## RT-1 Honest Benchmark — v1 (2026-04-14)

This section reports the RT-1 red-team benchmark run with Layer 2 keyed against Gemini 2.5 Flash. It replaces the v0.1 Preliminary checkpoint. Numbers are as-measured; limitations are listed at the end of this section — read them before citing.

### Run manifest

- corpus_hash: `e1674ba698fe495c11d7d343f3a81fc680bd6139d61174e8641f0d3a53f4325e`
- corpus_size: 585 payloads, 11 categories (A–K)
- total_rows: 2925 (585 payloads × 5 runners; N=5 repeats per payload aggregated into per-row rates)
- generated_at: 2026-04-14T23:22:07Z
- llm_model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- llm_base_url: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`
- runners: `layer1`, `layer2`, `hybrid`, `full_mcp` (reduced: scan + hybrid), `toctou` (URL-level)

### Headline (aggregate across 585 payloads)

| Runner | attack bypass % | benign FR % | avg N=5 flip % |
|---|---|---|---|
| layer1 | 58.4 | 7.8 | 0.0 |
| layer2 | 24.7 | 53.1 | 64.5 |
| **hybrid** | **15.6** | 58.3 | 47.7 |
| full_mcp (reduced) | 15.6 | 57.9 | 47.5 |
| toctou (C/H only) | 3.6 | 0.9 | 0.0 |

Read the table carefully:
- **Hybrid is the strongest attack-blocker** (15.6% bypass) but injects high false-reject cost (58.3%) on benign traffic.
- **Layer 2 alone is non-deterministic at this corpus size**: average per-category verdict-flip rate across the N=5 repeats is **64.5%**, i.e. the same payload yields a different `approved` boolean across identical repeats in most categories.
- **Layer 1 is fast and low-FR** (7.8%) but half of attacks bypass it.
- **TOCTOU** only meaningfully runs on categories C/H (domain-aware payloads); other categories correctly record `skip`.

### B-class decision (S0.2a pre-registered)
- bypass_rate_layer1 = 40.0%
- false_reject_rate_layer1 = 20.0%
- **decision: keep-deprecated** — bypass ≥25%, FR ≥15% → falls into deprecate-with-warnings bucket per `docs/CATEGORIES_DECISION_CRITERIA.md`.

### What this invalidates in the marketing claim

The header section of this document cites **"95% accuracy"** from a 20-payload hand-picked benchmark. The 585-payload keyed run does not reproduce that figure. Attack bypass for the hybrid path is **15.6%** (≈84% block) but false-reject on benign traffic is **58.3%** — meaning the single "accuracy" number collapses two orthogonal errors. A future revision of this document should replace the top-of-file claim with the v1 numbers above; that edit is held pending founder review.

### Limitations (unchanged from v0.1 — still apply)

- **Single LLM model.** `gemini-2.5-flash` via OpenAI-compat endpoint. No cross-model sweep. Different models will produce materially different numbers — the high verdict-flip rate here suggests this specific model is a poor fit for structured JSON-strict validation tasks at tight context.
- **Rate limiting during the run.** p95 latencies of 34–35 s for Layer-2-dependent paths reflect Gemini free-tier throttling and client-side retries, not real production latency. Re-run on a paid tier is required before publishing latency claims.
- **Full MCP runner is reduced** (scan heuristic + hybrid fall-through). The real stdio MCP client replacement is S1 scope.
- **TOCTOU** is URL-level, not CDP-event-level — it simulates mid-flight redirect by swapping the target URL, not by intercepting browser navigation events.
- **Benign counterpart coverage is category-dependent**; see per-category total_benign column.
- **Flip rate N=5 is an intra-run stability measure**, not a cross-seed measure. Different prompts or sampling temperatures will produce different flip profiles.

### Reproduce

```bash
export POP_LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."          # hard-required; harness refuses to run without
export POP_LLM_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
export POP_LLM_BASE_URL="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/"
POP_REDTEAM=1 npx tsx tests/redteam/run-corpus.ts --n=5 --concurrency=15
```

Artifact lands under `tests/redteam/runs/<timestamp>.jsonl`. API-key-shaped substrings are scrubbed before persistence (`scrubKey` / `_scrub_key`).
