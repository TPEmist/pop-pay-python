# Internal Documentation

These documents are **internal-facing** — intended for:

- Bounty researchers who have emailed `security@pop-pay.ai` and are coordinating disclosure
- Internal v2 design anchoring
- Future publishing decisions (not published now)

Public consumers should read the top-level [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md), [`docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`](../THREAT_MODEL.md), and [`docs/VAULT_THREAT_MODEL.md`](../VAULT_THREAT_MODEL.md) instead.

Content here is authoritative but may reference un-shipped mitigations, open gaps, or methodology details that we do not yet want in the public capability narrative.
